I realised I was doing the same thing over and over when starting a new build so decided to create my own mini bootstrap which has the basics for starting a simple static web site:


HTML5 Soundboard
================

About
-----

I wanted to create simple HTML5 soundboard to play clips of funny things a colleague of mine said. He was unwilling to record said snippets so I decided to fool around with the HTML5 Audio tag to see how easy it was.

The javascript was built around this blogcos many thanks :-)

Scope
-----

The scope was pretty small for this project:

* Only uses HTML5 Audio (mp3 and ogg)
* Only needs to work in modern browsers that support <audio>
* Ideally for use on mobile devices
